Abstract
This project extends an EVM-compatible network by enabling on-chain Bitcoin address generation and management. By forking Arbitrum and integrating additional cryptographic primitives into the EVM, our platform merges Bitcoin's security with Ethereum's programmability. The result is a network supporting Gnosis Safe–style multisig contracts augmented with Chainlink oracles for real-time Bitcoin data, thereby facilitating decentralized management of Bitcoin assets via smart contracts.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Bitcoin is the gold standard for decentralized digital currency, known for its robust security and pioneering technology. Meanwhile, Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks have enabled innovations like decentralized finance (DeFi) and multisig wallets (e.g., Gnosis Safe). Yet, a seamless, trustless bridge between Bitcoin and smart contracts remains largely unexplored.

1.2 Motivation
Current solutions often rely on off-chain or custodial models to represent Bitcoin on EVM networks. Our goal is to eliminate these intermediaries by:

On-Chain Bitcoin Address Generation: Allowing smart contracts to autonomously create and manage Bitcoin addresses.
Native Bitcoin Transaction Control: Enabling contract-driven Bitcoin transfers.
EVM Ecosystem Leverage: Building on a proven Arbitrum fork to maintain compatibility with tools like Chainlink and Gnosis Safe.
2. Problem Statement
Key challenges include:

Cryptographic Incompatibility: Bitcoin address generation requires specific cryptographic operations (e.g., SHA‑256, RIPEMD‑160, elliptic curve functions) not fully supported by the native EVM.
Secure Randomness: Generating private keys securely on-chain is a significant challenge due to blockchain determinism.
UTXO vs. Account Model: Bitcoin’s UTXO model contrasts with Ethereum’s account-based system, necessitating custom integration approaches.
Bridging Gaps: Current Bitcoin-EVM bridges rely on external custodians or off-chain protocols, introducing trust issues our design seeks to resolve.
3. Proposed Solution
Our solution is to fork the Arbitrum codebase and extend the EVM to include Bitcoin-specific cryptographic functions and secure randomness. Key components include:

Enhanced EVM Capabilities:

New Cryptographic Opcodes: Integrate opcodes for SHA‑256 and optimize RIPEMD‑160 operations.
Secure Randomness Generation: Develop or incorporate mechanisms for verifiable randomness for key generation.
Elliptic Curve Operations: Extend support for Bitcoin’s elliptic curve cryptography for on-chain key management and signing.
Smart Contract Integration:

Gnosis Safe–Style Contracts: Adapt multisig contracts to manage Bitcoin addresses and funds.
Chainlink Oracle Integration: Use Chainlink oracles to feed real-time Bitcoin network data into our smart contracts.
On-Chain Bitcoin Address Management:

Address Generation: Enable autonomous, on-chain Bitcoin address creation.
Transaction Execution: Design mechanisms that allow smart contracts to trigger or validate Bitcoin transactions with minimal off-chain intervention.
4. Technical Architecture
4.1 EVM Modifications
Opcode Extensions:

SHA‑256 Opcode: Introduce a new opcode for efficient SHA‑256 hashing.
Enhanced RIPEMD‑160: Optimize the existing opcode for compatibility with Bitcoin standards.
Additional Opcodes: Create opcodes for secure randomness and elliptic curve calculations.
Toolchain Enhancements:

Compiler Intrinsics: Update the Solidity compiler to expose new opcodes via intrinsics or libraries.
Debugging & Gas Calibration: Adapt development tools for accurate gas estimations and debugging support.
4.2 Multisig and Oracle Integration
Gnosis Safe–Style Contracts:

Architecture: Utilize the Gnosis Safe framework to create multisig contracts that control Bitcoin addresses.
Security: Implement threshold-based signing and multi-party approval for Bitcoin transactions.
Chainlink Oracle Integration:

Oracle Nodes: Leverage Chainlink to deliver real-time Bitcoin network data.
Trigger Mechanisms: Create contract logic that initiates Bitcoin transfers based on oracle data.
4.3 Hybrid On-Chain/Off-Chain Mechanism
While maximizing on-chain functionality is the goal, certain operations (like signing and broadcasting Bitcoin transactions) may require:

Federated Signers/Threshold Signatures: A system where off-chain signers finalize Bitcoin transactions under on-chain rules.
Interoperability Bridge: Ensuring a seamless link between on-chain decisions and off-chain execution, with minimized trust assumptions.
5. Security Considerations
Given the extensive EVM modifications and integration with Bitcoin cryptography, security is paramount:

Rigorous Code Audits: Engage third-party auditors for both the modified EVM and smart contract implementations.
Formal Verification: Apply formal methods to critical cryptographic components.
Bug Bounty Programs: Incentivize the community to identify and report vulnerabilities.
Incremental Rollouts: Deploy on testnets with extensive testing before mainnet launch.
6. Roadmap

## About Arbitrum Nitro

<img src="https://arbitrum.io/assets/arbitrum/logo_color.png" alt="Logo" width="80" height="80">

Nitro is the latest iteration of the Arbitrum technology. It is a fully integrated, complete
layer 2 optimistic rollup system, including fraud proofs, the sequencer, the token bridges,
advanced calldata compression, and more.

See the live docs-site [here](https://developer.arbitrum.io/) (or [here](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-docs) for markdown docs source.)

See [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/audit-reports) for security audit reports.

The Nitro stack is built on several innovations. At its core is a new prover, which can do Arbitrum’s classic
interactive fraud proofs over WASM code. That means the L2 Arbitrum engine can be written and compiled using
standard languages and tools, replacing the custom-designed language and compiler used in previous Arbitrum
versions. In normal execution,
validators and nodes run the Nitro engine compiled to native code, switching to WASM if a fraud proof is needed.
We compile the core of Geth, the EVM engine that practically defines the Ethereum standard, right into Arbitrum.
So the previous custom-built EVM emulator is replaced by Geth, the most popular and well-supported Ethereum client.

The last piece of the stack is a slimmed-down version of our ArbOS component, rewritten in Go, which provides the
rest of what’s needed to run an L2 chain: things like cross-chain communication, and a new and improved batching
and compression system to minimize L1 costs.

Essentially, Nitro runs Geth at layer 2 on top of Ethereum, and can prove fraud over the core engine of Geth
compiled to WASM.

Arbitrum One successfully migrated from the Classic Arbitrum stack onto Nitro on 8/31/22. (See [state migration](https://developer.arbitrum.io/migration/state-migration) and [dapp migration](https://developer.arbitrum.io/migration/dapp_migration) for more info).

## License

Nitro is currently licensed under a [Business Source License](./LICENSE.md), similar to our friends at Uniswap and Aave, with an "Additional Use Grant" to ensure that everyone can have full comfort using and running nodes on all public Arbitrum chains.

The Additional Use Grant also permits the deployment of the Nitro software, in a permissionless fashion and without cost, as a new blockchain provided that the chain settles to either Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova.

For those that prefer to deploy the Nitro software either directly on Ethereum (i.e. an L2) or have it settle to another Layer-2 on top of Ethereum, the [Arbitrum Expansion Program (the "AEP")](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/aep/ArbitrumExpansionProgramTerms.pdf) was recently established. The AEP allows for the permissionless deployment in the aforementioned fashion provided that 10% of net revenue (as more fully described in the AEP) is contributed back to the Arbitrum community in accordance with the requirements of the AEP.
